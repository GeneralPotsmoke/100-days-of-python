#### Day 3: Control Flow and Logical Operators
**Challenge:** Create a program that checks if a number entered by the user is positive, negative, or zero, and prints an appropriate message.

```python
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if number > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
elif number < 0:
    print("The number is negative.")
else:
    print("The number is zero.")
```
